<b class="first-letter">I</b> completely despise reading and writing. Sorry, I meant to say, “despised” reading and writing.
All throughout high school's summer and winter readings, I probably read a total of 3 books. I completely bs’d my way through the essays and analyses (shoutout to Sparknotes and Shmoop). In addition to my lack of appeal in reading, I was terrible at writing. Although I envied those who were naturally good at writing, I didn’t care enough to put in the work to become better at it.

Within the last few months of 2019, I realized that I should read Christian books in order to broaden my perspective on the many different glories of God. The interest that initially was to help grow my knowledge of who God is, slowly turned into a hobby. If I'm being honest, I hated the fact that I enjoyed reading. Where was this in highschool? I picked up _1984_ by George Orwell, _Tuesdays with Morrie_  by Mitch Albom, and (the book I recently just finished) _Pachinko_ by Min Jin Lee. On the more religious side of it, I read _Crazy Love_ by Nathan Chan, _Screwtape Letters_ by C.S. Lewis, and I am currently reading _Mere Christianity_ by the same author. I’m baffled at the fact that I have read more books in the last 5 months than in my 4 years of high school.

Being invested in any hobby, it’s always natural to do your research about that interest. I’m sure you’ve all heard this from your english teachers: reading is a good stress reliever, you’ll concentrate better, or some other life changing benefit. Beyond the stress relief and concentration, the benefit of reading that still has me reading to this day would be comprehension. Imagine being able to understand most of what you read. That’s powerful. In software development, there’s an unbelievable amount of documentation to be read. I needed to read in order to further my potential as a developer and as a perpetual student.

After months of reading, I still don’t zoom through books, I still have to reread sentences to understand what they mean, but I know it’ll be worth it. I challenge you to go read, literally anything. Go read a news article, a blog post, or even better, a book. I can’t assure you that it’ll be easy, but the hardest part of many tasks in life is to start the task. Let’s take advantage of this privilege to be able to read.
